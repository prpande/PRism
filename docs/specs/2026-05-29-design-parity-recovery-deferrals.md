# Design parity recovery — deferrals sidecar

Companion to [`2026-05-29-design-parity-recovery-design.md`](2026-05-29-design-parity-recovery-design.md) and the PR1 plan [`2026-05-29-design-parity-recovery-pr1-foundation.md`](../plans/2026-05-29-design-parity-recovery-pr1-foundation.md). Captures decisions / deferrals that surface during implementation; new entries are appended below.

## PR1 — Foundation

### D1 — HandoffParityFixture: cost-to-gate fallback selected
**Date:** 2026-05-29 (PR1 implementation).
**Spec §:** 4.1.1.
**Decision:** Skip the new `HandoffParityFixture` C# class and the `POST /test/load-handoff-parity-fixture` endpoint. PR1 ships no fixture work. Side-by-side review uses the existing `acme/api/123` scenario fixture (`FakeReviewBackingStore.Scenario`) as the implementation side; the locally-loaded handoff prototype (`design/handoff/PRism.html`) provides the reference side.
**Why:** `FakeReviewBackingStore.Scenario` is a `public static readonly` field hardcoded across `FakePrReader`, `FakePrDiscovery`, `FakeReviewSubmitter`, and the test endpoints in `PRism.Web/TestHooks/TestEndpoints.cs`. Multi-scenario extension requires either a registry refactor (every fake takes a per-call reference; the singleton becomes a dictionary) or a parallel store singleton (separate DI registration). Either path is 2-3 days of work plus rework risk on the existing E2E suite (24 specs depend on the current single-scenario shape). The spec's cost-to-gate threshold (~1 day) is exceeded. The marginal value of identical fixture content over the locally-loaded prototype is acknowledged but is not the parity gate — the human side-by-side review is, per spec §4.1.4.
**Consequence:** Reviewers comparing the implementation side against the prototype work with *different PRs* (acme/api/123 "Calc utilities" vs handoff's `#1842` "Refactor LeaseRenewalProcessor"). The comparison is structural ("does this section's card layout match?") rather than content-matched ("does the title wrap at the same column?"). Per spec §4.1.4 this is acceptable for the parity gate; § 4.1.1's stated benefit of "exercises the real render pipeline" still holds because the scenario fixture also exercises the real render pipeline.
**Reversible:** Yes. If a later PR finds the comparison-on-different-content harder than anticipated, a follow-up slice can pay the extension cost. PR1 sets up no obstacle to that.
**Cross-refs:** Spec §4.1.1 cost-to-gate fallback paragraph; the `setupAndOpenHandoffParityFixture` helper landing in Task 4 is a thin alias rather than a fixture-loading entry point.

### D2 — Reconciliation-panel baseline deferred to PR5
**Date:** 2026-05-29 (PR1 implementation).
**Spec §:** 4.1.3.
**Decision:** Drop the `pr-detail-reconciliation-panel` test from PR1's `parity-baselines.spec.ts`. Re-add it in PR5 when the reconciliation surface is restored.
**Why:** The `UnresolvedPanel` component currently exposes only `data-testid="unresolved-panel-announce"` (an aria-live region inside the component) — there is no container `data-testid` to capture the panel's visual zone. Adding a container `data-testid` is a JSX touch that belongs in PR5's slice (where `UnresolvedPanel` gets its module CSS). PR1's "no production code edits" rule (§4.1.5) prevents adding the selector here. The baseline for the dormant reconciliation panel state captures in PR5 alongside the styled state.
**Reversible:** Yes. PR5 re-adds the test definition + adds the container `data-testid` + captures the baseline in one slice.
**Cross-refs:** Spec §4.1.3 zone list; spec §4.5 PR5 scope (Reconciliation surface).

### D3 — Sibling 401 endpoints (PrSubmit / PrDraftsDiscardAll) not flipped
**Date:** 2026-05-29 (PR1 implementation).
**Spec §:** 4.1.2.
**Decision:** Leave `PrSubmitEndpoints.SubmitAsync`, `ResumeForeignPendingReviewAsync`, `DiscardForeignPendingReviewAsync`, and `PrDraftsDiscardAllEndpoint.DiscardAllAsync` returning 401 (`"unauthorized"` SubmitErrorDto code) on `IsSubscribed == false`. Do NOT flip them to 403 in PR1.
**Why:** These are user-triggered mutating actions (submit, resume, discard). For the dev-mode cascade to fire, the user would have to dispatch one of these actions BEFORE the SSE-subscribe loop completes — which is structurally rare (the subscribe POST is `useEffect`-driven and fires on PR-detail mount, well before any user can click Submit or Resume). The Events/Subscribe path is different because it fires *automatically* on every PR detail navigation, so its 401 is the one that user-visibly bounces. Flipping submit/resume/discard would be a defensive change with no current symptom.
**Reversible:** Yes. If a future report observes a dev-mode bounce from a Submit action, the same 401→403 reasoning applies — flip those endpoints in a follow-up slice. `apiClient.ts`'s 401→prism-auth-rejected dispatch stays the load-bearing trigger; widening the 401→403 conversion is a narrow surface.
**Cross-refs:** Audit performed in PR1 plan Task 2 Step 2.6; affected endpoints enumerated in `grep -rn "Status401Unauthorized" PRism.Web/Endpoints/` output.
