# PRism

Local-first PR review tool that runs on the reviewer's own machine. See [`docs/spec/`](docs/spec/) for the full specification and [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for the implementation slice plan.

## Status

Pre-implementation; the foundations slice (`docs/specs/2026-05-05-foundations-and-setup-design.md`) is in flight. See [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for the broader slice list.

## Development workflow

Two terminals.

```
# terminal 1 — backend with hot reload (pinned to 5180 in dev)
dotnet watch run --project PRism.Web --urls http://localhost:5180

# terminal 2 — frontend dev server (Vite proxies /api to localhost:5180)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run all tests:

```
dotnet test
cd frontend && npm test && npx playwright test
```

Run a single backend test:

```
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AppStateStoreTests"
```

Run a single frontend test:

```
cd frontend && npx vitest run __tests__/setup.test.tsx
```

## Process

All production code is written test-first (red → green → refactor). See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) § Development process.
